    <p style="padding-left:10px;">My first attempt at developing a game, I plunged into Unity with C# and had a blast. 
        The rough concept is a survival game where you start off stranded and slowly
        build your society (extremely original, I know).

        The most noteworthy part of this project is that I made all of the assets myself. Everything
        you see in the GIF was digitally drawn by me. The walking animation of the main character
        contains around 64 frames.
