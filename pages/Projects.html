    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right: 10px;">My first attempt at developing a game, I plunged into Unity with C# and had a blast. 
        The rough concept is a survival game where you start off stranded and slowly
        build your society.    
        <br>
        <br>
        The most noteworthy part of this project is that I made all of the assets myself. Everything
        you see in the GIF was digitally drawn by me. The walking animation of the main character
        contains around 64 frames.

    <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right: 10px;">My current game development project is a 2D platformer that has a jump streak system.
        The idea is that the more jumps you land in a row, the faster you move and the farther you jump. This is meant to 
        encourage fast paced gameplay.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is very much a work in progress, my current objective is to refine the jump mechanic so that it feels 
        satisfying and responsive. All the art is placeholder art, I'll be updating this entry as I make more progress.
