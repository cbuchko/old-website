<div class = "lead-in"> In this post I take a stab at writing a scene for my favourite TV show, Community. This script is an imagination of the conversation that would have taken place the day after Parasite historically swept the Oscars. </div>

<br>

<div class = "action">  <strong>MONDAY MORNING. THE GREENDALE SEVEN SITS AROUND THE STUDY ROOM TABLE.</strong> </div>

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p>  
Good morning! How was everyone's weekend?

<p class = "character"> ABED  </p>
I watched The Passion of the Christ. Wasn't a very faithful adaptation of the book.

<p class= "character"> TROY  </p>
I went to a duck pond to feed the ducks... but I ate all the bread before I got there.

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY  </p>
Did anyone else watch Parasite win four Oscars? Big night for Korea.

<div class = "action">  Shrugs and silence across the group. </div>

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY (CONT'D)  </p>
Nobody watched it or nobody's happy for Korea?

<p class = "character"> JEFF  </p>
Shirley, we don't all have enough time to watch four hours of Hollywood jerking itself off. But of course we are happy for <strong>South</strong> Korea.

<p class = "character"> PIERCE  </p>
Speak for yourself Jeffrey.

<div class = "action">  Everyone glares at Pierce, except Troy. </div>

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
In Pierce's defense, the Oscars viewership has been dropping recently. Maybe it was time to spice it up.

<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
Troy... Pierce was referring to South Korea.

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
Oh... me too...

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY  </p>
What about you Abed? Surely you watched the Oscars.

<p class = "character"> ABED  </p>
I'm with Jeff on this one. I don't think their target audience is people who know anything about film. It's more so middle-age divorcees.

<div class = "action">  Shirley is visibly upset. Britta feels bad. </div>

<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
That's not true Abed. I know plenty of people that watched it.

<p class = "character"> JEFF  </p>
Do you know anyone that doesn't go to Greendale?

<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
Shaa... my parents...

<div class = "action">  Shirley gets more upset. </div>

<p class = "character"> JEFF  </p>
Okay, at the end of the day, Shirley is allowed to like what she wants. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. I record reruns of Wipe-out, Troy might have a masturbation fixation, and Shirley enjoys the Academy Awards.

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
Wait... the Oscars and the Academy Awards are the same thing?

<p class = "character"> PIERCE  </p>
Of course they are dummy. The Academy Awards get rebroadcast as the Oscars for the Mexican audience.

<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
Oh no. Does that mean the Tony's were last night as well? I promised an Italian chick I'd watch it with her.

<div class = "action">  Opening sequence. </div>
