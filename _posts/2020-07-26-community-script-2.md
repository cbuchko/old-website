<div class = "lead-in">I'm back nearly a month later with my second attempt at a Community scene. This one doesn't really have a clear theme but I hope you enjoy it.</div>

<br>

<div class = "action">  <strong>A REGULAR MORNING. THE STUDY GROUP IS SITTING AROUND THE TABLE, EXCEPT FOR BRITTA, WHO HAS NOT ARRIVED YET. </strong> </div>


<div class = "action">Britta walks into the study room, eating a banana.</div>

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
Britta, this is the fourth day in a row you've walked in eating a banana. 

<p class = "character"> PIERCE </p>  
Compensating much?

<p class = "character"> BRITTA </p>
I went grocery shopping and bought too many. Now I have to eat them all before they spoil.  

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p>  
If they spoil, you could always make banana bread.

<p class = "character"> BRITTA </p>  
That is such a cliche. Buying bananas shouldn't come with the obligation of baking bread.

<p class = "character"> ABED </p>  
Ooh, like how great power always comes with great responsibility.

<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
Or how drinking coffee always comes with the obligation of diarrhea.

<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
Alright, I officially declare this conversation as stupid.

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
You're just saying that because you can't think of one.

<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
No, because me coming up with one would just show that I care.

<p class = "character"> PIERCE </p> 
I've always thought being a man shouldn't mean you have to pay for the first date.

<div class = "action">Everyone is pleasantly surprised and nods.</div>

<p class = "character"> PIERCE (CONT'D) </p> 
Especially when you know she isn't coming over after for a little razzmatazz.

<div class = "action">The groups agreement turns to disgust.</div>

<div class = "action">Awkward silence for a beat.</div>

<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
Okay Annie, if this is so easy, what is your nugget of wisdom?

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
Well... uh... I don't think being born in Kazakhstan should mean you have to preform your own circumcision? 

<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
You clearly just made that up.

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
Prove me wrong.

<div class = "action">The Dean walks into the room.</div>

<p class = "character"> THE DEAN </p> 
Hello!

<p class = "character"> TROY </p>
Sorry Dean, we're in the middle of a weirdly intense conversation and I'm having a really hard time following it.

<p class = "character"> THE DEAN </p>
I was gonna let you know about the anti-pacifism riot in the quad but this seems much more important. What's going on?

<p class = "character"> ABED </p> 
We're talking about the pressures of society and how we often have expectations thrust upon us.

<p class = "character"> THE DEAN </p>
Oh like those poor children in Kazakhstan? I mean that stuff is just barbaric.
