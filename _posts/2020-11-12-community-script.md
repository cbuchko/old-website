<div class = "lead-in">After a bit of a hiatus I have finished my fourth Community fan script. This one takes place the morning after Greendales Halloween dance.</div>

<br>

<div class = "action"><strong>COLD OPEN - INT. GREENDALE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDY ROOM - DAY.</strong></div>
<div class = "action">The morning after a halloween dance at Greendale, the study group is sitting around the study room table, except for Troy and Abed, who are just walking in together. They are mid-conversation.</div>

<p class = "character"> ABED </p> 
I still don't understand why that group of people was dressed up as Thing 1, Thing 2, Thing 3, and Thing 4. There were only 1 and 2 in the book.

<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
I know! If you're gonna just make up your costume you really aren't dressing up as anything.

<div class = "action">Troy and Abed take their seats at the table.</div>

<p class = "character"> BRITTA </p> 
Halloween is a lot more than a costume contest. It's a celebration of culture, a chance for people to escape from their daily lives. You guys should keep that in mind before you go around RuPauling other peoples outfits.

<div class = "action">Silence for a beat.</div>

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p> 
Sorry I couldn't make it to the dance last night...

<div class = "action">The group mumbles false assurances to Shirley.</div>

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY (CONT'D) </p> 
You guys realized I was missing right?

<p class = "character"> PIERCE </p> 
Don't worry, I noticed.

<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
The only thing you missed from last night was drunk Britta.
<br>
(to Britta)
<br>
Watching you dance is more awkward than watching an air guitar solo at Karaoke.

<div class = "action">The PA system sounds on. The Deans voice blares over its speakers.</div>

<p class = "character"> THE DEAN (O.S) </p> 
Attention Greendaliens! It turns out someone preformed a mis-dean-meanor at the dance last night. The culprit was caught going around with a needle and discretely pricking people. This fulfills our legal obligation to inform you, I hope you all have a good day. Bye!

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
Is everyone all right?

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p> 
Everyone?

<p class = "character"> ABED </p> 
Troy and I are fine. We had to leave early after eating too many Scooby snacks.

<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
We reached new levels of authenticity but I didn't solve the mystery of how the real Shaggy could eat so many dog treats. Somehow he was always in a snacky mood.

<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p> 
I just hope the Lord can forgive you all for participating in a junkies recruitment camp.

<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
Hold on, we aren't even sure what was in those needles.

<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p> 
Well it's safe to say it wasn't water.

<p class = "character"> ABED </p> 
Yeah nobody would do this unless they had something to gain from it.

<p class = "character"> JEFF </p> 
Like the need to make life more like TV?

<p class = "character"> ABED </p> 
I was leaning more towards them injecting DNA instructions into our bloodstream, turning us into sleeper agents so that when the time is right they could activate us and kidnap the Governor of Michigan.

<p class = "character"> TROY </p> 
Yeah, or the needle had AIDS in it.

<div class = "action">Everyone dismisses Troy.</div>

<p class = "character"> BRITTA </p> 
Could we give them the benefit of the doubt..? Maybe it was a vaccine?

<p class = "character"> PIERCE</p> 
Britta's right. We were all dangerously close to catching autism.

<div class = "action">Opening sequence.</div>
