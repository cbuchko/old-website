Community is a special sitcom in a similar vein of The Office, Parks and Recreation, and Brooklyn 99. It thrives off its amazing cast, clever writing, and unafraidness to go beyond what was expected from a typical TV show. This combination resulted in a show that produced countless episodes that I would consider to be some of the best TV ever made.

Now I'm gonna try to do my best to list my fifteen favourite of these.
