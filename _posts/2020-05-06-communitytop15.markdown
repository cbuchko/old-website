Community is a special sitcom in a similar vein of The Office, Parks and Recreation, and Brooklyn 99. It thrives off its amazing cast, clever writing, and unafraidness to go beyond what was expected from a typical TV show. This combination resulted in a show that produced countless episodes that I would consider to be some of the best TV ever made. Some of these episodes stand out because of their hilarity, others because of how out of the box the concepts are but the main thing I love about Community is the heart and wholesomeness at its center. Now I'm gonna try to do my best to list my fifteen favourite of these.

Before I get into it, let me preface this by saying that 80% of the shows episodes are episodes that I would gladly rewatch countless times and it's extremely hard to pigeonhole just fifteen.  But without further ado...

## 10. Debate 109

Debate 109 is a really great example of a Community episode that doesn't try to push the envelope too hard and instead is grounded in antics you could expect from a real life study group. 

This episode is the birth of the Jeff and Annie will they/won't they romance that the future seasons base a lot of plot points around. 

## 9. Epidemiology

Ironically, this Halloween episode is unforgettable. The episode wastes no time and starts off in the midsts of the Halloween party. 

## 8. Regional Holiday Music

I thoroughly enjoy every Christmas episode but this one stands out for how much pure fun it is. I'm a sucker for goofy songs and I love the concept of each one of them slowly getting indoctrinated into the glee cult. 

The songs in this episode are so good that I genuinely want to make a tier list just ranking these songs. Troy and Abeds rap is absolutely iconic and I find myself saying thank you to Baby Boomer Santa at least once a day.

The craziness of the episode culminates with a very heartfelt moment in Troy and Abeds apartment where the whole gang gets together to enjoy Christmas. Moments like these turn a goofy glee parody episode into a really sentimental piece.

## 7. Contemporary American Poultry

On This first full fledge homage episode checks all of the boxes. 

## 6. Studies in Modern Movement

One of the most rewarding experiences when watching Community from start to finish is learning the idiosyncrasies of each member in the Greendale Seven. After several watch throughs of the show, I am very confident that the #AnniesMove episode has the best individual character moments in the series.

We see Troy and Abeds nerdy and quirky friendship collide with Annies uptight and self-conscious need to fit in. Britta the inactive activist quarrells with Shirley the judmental christian. And of course Pierce is Pierce.

Most importantly, this episode gives an insight to what makes Jeff tick. At first glance he is avoiding #AnniesMove because he's lazy. On rewatches it is apparent he more so wants to be alone because he's struggling with depression. 

Every character has their moment and it all comes together for a montage backdropped to Kiss from a Rose, a top five scene in the show for me. For these reasons, I actually think this episode is a great episode for introducing someone to the show. 

## 5. A Fistful of Paintballs/For a Few Paintballs More

<img class="blog-image" src="/images/community_episodes/paintball.png" alt="paintball" />

Is it cheating to list a two part episode as one?

The paintball episodes are the most well known episodes in Community for a reason. The first one, Modern Warfare, set the standard for all homage episodes to come and for me, this two parter takes the cake.

Similar to Epidemiology, the episode starts off with the paintball game already underaway. Each scene is meaningful and doesn't feel like an unnecessary rehashing of Modern Warfare. 

The aesthetic of the Spaghetti Western from the cinematography, to the fight choreography, to the costumes is nailed so perfectly that you can't help but smile everytime a new character card flashes the screen. When it turns into Star Wars, it doesn't skip a beat. Abed as Han Solo is hilarious and I love that Pierce was the one to save the day.

Kevin Feige enjoyed this episode so much that he hired the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, for Captain America: Winter Solider, which is probably the biggest testament to how good these episodes really are.

## 4. Cooperative Calligraphy

<img class="blog-image" src="/images/community_episodes/cooperative_calligraphy.jpg" alt="Cooperative Calligraphy" />

Annie loses a pen and the entire episode is a conversation about the where abouts of the pen. The idea behind an episode that relies solely on character interactions is fantastic. 

The writing team and the actors really shine through with this episode. There is no paintball game or zombie invasion to move the plot, instead airtight back and forth conversation provides constant laughs.

The slow descent into insanity is done extremely well here. The different characters motivations and reasonings for putting up with the pen search ends up being weirdly believable. It isn't until the episode ends when you realize that 22 minutes went by and you just witnissed the most pure Community there is.

## 3. Conspiracy Theories and Interior Design

<img class="blog-image" src="/images/community_episodes/conspiracy_theories.jpg" alt="conspiracy theories" />

This episode is nearly perfect because it has two equally compelling storylines that could easily standalone. Professor Professorson and night school is a stroke of genius and Troy and Abeds blanket fort was so beloved it spawned two future episodes.

The prop gun fight is peak Community, and is a great example of how it isn't afraid to commit fully to a joke. The Deans reaction to Jeff getting shot never fails to make me laugh.

## 2. Environmental Science

## 1. Remedial Chaos Theory
