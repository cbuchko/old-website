Season 50 of Survivor is five years away and it will be undoubtably be the biggest season yet. A season of the biggest characters to ever play the game makes the most sense and would be even more hype than Winners at War was. In my mind, a legend isn't just an amazing player, but someone who's name is synonymous with Survivor. Someone who has played multiple times and has consistently brought the entertainment and gameplay.

For this list, I'm not necessarily trying to predict what I think the cast would be, I'm just saying what my dream cast is. A couple of these players I would be genuinely shocked if they ended up playing again. I also did my best to get a good spread over the 20 years of Survivor. I didn't want this cast to be a repeat of Heroes vs. Villians or Winners at War. So starting with the males:

## Tony Vlachos

If there's ever a Legends season, the King himself has to be on the cast. Undisputibly the best to ever play the game, Tony has shown countless times that he will do whatever it takes to win. 

The great thing about Tony is that he's also one of the biggest characters to ever play the game. He's made the spy shack, spy bunker and spy nest, found multiple idols and is fluent in llama, who knows what else he has left in his arsenel. 

## Benjamin "Coach" Wade

When I think of Survivor "Legends", Coach is the first person I think of and I would be the most excited to see him back. 

## Boston Rob Mariano

While making this list, I asked myself, "Boston Rob has played five times, do we really need to see him a sixth?" Of course we do. Boston Rob may be the most imposing character to ever play Survivor. Even in Winners at War, Rob was in danger the moment he stepped on the beach. 

The great thing about a Legends season is that the overall threat level of the cast would be even higher than in Winners at War. This could be Robs chance to make another deep run and finally win again.

## Rob Cesternino

Last time Cesternino played was Season 8, All-Stars, and somehow his reputation still carries on to this day. Cesternino has influenced how the game is played almost more than any other player (only second to the person who helped create the idea of an 'alliance'). 

In the Amazon, he was the first person to play the middle between the two main alliances, constantly flipping between whichever one most suited his needs. And although he didn't win the game, he came damn close. Since then, Cesternino is extremely active in the Survivor community, being probably the biggest content creator with his podcast.

## Malcolm Freberg

Malcom was another no-brainer for me. The best to ever play the "Golden Boy" archetype, Malcolm is extremely charismatic and incredibly fun to watch. I think he takes the Ozzy approach where he provides and is a beast in challenges, but he also has a social game and isn't a douchebag.

Seeing Malcolm play in a season like this would be very interesting where he would be able to blend into the background a little bit. 

## Jeremy Collins

Jeremy was someone I was slightly hesitant about putting on the list. After watching Winners at War, do I really need to see him play again? But when you put in persective that season 50 is still five years away, I think I would want to see him in 2025.

Jeremy is probably the most well-rounded player in survivor history. He is absolutely built for challenges, he is incredibly strategic and his social game is what won him Cambodia. The first person to master the 'Meat Shield' strategy, he definitely deserves to be on a Legends season.

## Richard Hatch

It would be wrong to do a Legends season without the first person to ever win Survivor. Hatch was ahead of the curve back in Borneo. He was the only person who was really thinking about the game analyticaly and it showed in his strategy. As I mentioned before, he created the first alliance, and made one of the cleverest moves ever when he purposefully lost the final immunity challenge.

I'm not entirely sure if Hatch would actually come back. He almost was on Winners at War but was cut at the last minute, so we know he wants to. But his drama with CBS might mean that we will never see him again.

## John Cochran

Some people don't like Cochran, but I absolutely adore him. His two season transformation from nervous, nerotic nerd to winning in dominating fashion is inspiring. 

Cochran is also one of two people to play a perfect game and would probably have the most Survivor knowledge of anyone on the island. I want Cochran back just because I need to see his confessionals of him making fun of Coach for one more season, please CBS.

## Jonathon Penner

Penner is a class act, an amazing human, and an incredibly fun person to watch. He's the best narrator the show has ever had, you can tell he's a writer by the way he so eloquently gives his confessionals.

The problem with Penner is that I would be shocked if he actually ever played again. The man has so much on his plate, with his wife Stacy's ALS. He really can't afford to take 50 days off to go on an island. So even though I would love to have Penner back, I understand why it will probably never happen.

## Russell Hantz

And of course, you can't talk about the most notorious to play the game without mentioning Russell Hantz. The biggest villian to ever play, Russel is Tony but also an asshole. So in reality, Russell really isn't that good at Survivor, but he sure as hell is a Legend.

Russell burned a lot of bridges with CBS over the years but it's been ten years since the last time he played. By the time season 50 rolls around, I doubt CBS will be able to turn down the opportunity.
