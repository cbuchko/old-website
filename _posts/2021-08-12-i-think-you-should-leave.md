Almost a year ago I made a blog post claiming Nathan For You was the funniest show I've seen. But I can now confidently claim that I Think You Should Leave with Tom Robinson is the hardest I've laughed in my entire life. The first time watching the show I was constantly in tears, *literally* I was crying. Merely remembering some of my favourite sketches gets an audible laugh out of me. The show is absurd, stupid, and at times cringey, but Jesus Christ it's funny.

Similar to Saturday Night Live, I Think You Should Leave is a sketch comedy show. Currently there are two seasons, twelve episodes total, and each episode is less than 20 minutes. The entire experience is extremely short and fast-paced, which is perfect for a sketch show because they don't dwell too long on the duds. And there are some duds, but I know people that *love* some of my least favourite sketches, so the show is a cosmic gumbo that anyone can enjoy.

And it only gets better on re-watches. The first viewing is tough because the cringe can be a little too heavy. It's like how when you watch a really good horror movie, it's hard to enjoy it without knowing when the jump scares are coming. But once you're prepared for the cringiest moments, the absurdity becomes an inside joke, and it's easier to appreciate the more subtle and nuanced humor. There were sketches that didn't get any laughs from me on the first watch that are now some of my favourites.

I want to talk about a couple of my favourite sketches in an effort to give an overview of what the show has to offer.

## Ghost Tour

From here on out this blog post is for adults only, which means I can say whatever the *hell* I want.

Ghost Tour is one of the most stupid, infantile and childish sketches in the entire show. Really the entire joke is Tim Robinson's character is a guest in a Ghost Tour and he repeatedly interrupts with crass questions. But it works because his character is genuinely curious about the ghosts. He *isn't* trying to be funny and he *isn't* trying to get a laugh, he is fully sincere when he asks questions about whether the ghosts run around nude and whether they take dumps on the floor. And my immature brain loves it.

## Hot Dog Car Crash

Most I Think You Should Leave episodes have a formula: Asshole gets called out for being wrong, Asshole doubles down and refuses to admit they're wrong, Asshole makes the situation far worse for themselves and suffers the consequences. Hot Dog Car Crash might be the best example of this formula.

Tim Robinson has crashed his hot dog shaped car into a clothing store. Tim tries to get away with it by hiding in the crowd of guests inside and he leads the witch hunt to "catch" the culprit. The joke is that Tim is in a hot dog suit, so it's immediately obvious that he was the driver. Tim's persistence to deny his guilt as he gaslights the rest of the customers is quintessential I Think You Should Leave.

## The Day Robert Palins Murdered Me

If Ghost Tour is the show at peak stupidity, The Day That Robert Palins Murdered Me is the show at peak absurdity. Tim's band is demoing a gospel song for a producer, but the producer isn't a fan of it because gospel isn't popular anymore. So the bands lead singer starts improvising a new song, a soulful song about a cowboys murder. Tim's character, who doesn't know this new song at all, proceeds to ruin the performance by interjecting about "The Night that the Skeletons Come to Life".

Some of the lyrics include *the bones are their money, the worms are their dollars* and *they'll pull your hair up but **not** out*. It makes 0 sense and the producer hates it, but like many of the show's best sketches, the absolute confidence Tim has when performing the train wreck makes the sketch top tier.

<br>

There are many other amazing sketches that I didn't mention, like Tim dressing up as Karl Havoc for a prank show. But really a lot of these sketches are best seen with no context at all. So please, if you haven't seen it yet, take 20 minutes to watch just the first episode. You won't regret it.
