<div class = "lead-in"> My first fan-made Community script in 2021 is inspired by real events.</div>

<br>

<div class = "action"><strong>INT. STUDY ROOM - MORNING</strong></div>
<div class = "action">The study group walks into the study room together. Centered on the table is a traffic stoplight with its green light on. The group is confused.</div>
<p class = "character"> JEFF </p>
Annie, are you about to give another one of your PSA's on the dangers of designated driving?
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p>
No.. but is it so bad to point out that driving a car filled with drunks could be distracting?
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p>
Compared to being drunk yourself?
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p>
Compared to calling a cab! Pay a little extra money and leave the risk to the professional!
<p class = "character"> ABED </p>
How much extra money do I need to change the subject?
<div class = "action"> As he speaks, Abed walks over to the traffic light and starts examining it. The light changes from green to yellow.</div>
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p>
Careful Abed, I don't think it likes that.
<div class = "action">Abed backs away slowly but the light stays yellow. Everyone takes their seats at the table.</div>
<p class = "character"> ANNIE </p>
How are we supposed to study with this thing in the way?
<p class = "character">  JEFF </p>
Don't worry about that.
<div class = "action"> Jeff picks up the traffic light and begins to walk away. The group yells at him to be careful and to put it back. The light turns from yellow to red and an alarm blares.</div>
<p class = "character">  ABED </p>
Something really awesome or really terrible is about to happen.
<p class = "character">  TROY </p>
Like Heath Ledger's Joker or Jared Leto's Joker.
<div class = "action"> The Dean walks into the room. Abed is disappointed.</div>
<p class = "character"> ABED  </p>
Nicholson's Joker...
<p class = "character"> THE DEAN  </p>
Good morning, I heard you guys getting acquainted with the study groups newest member.
<p class = "character">  ANNIE </p>
Sorry Dean, the position of robot is filled and Abed's much more Iron Giant than this HAL 9000.
<div class = "action">Annie looks to Abed for approval of her movie references, Abed gives her a thumbs up.</div>
<p class = "character"> SHIRLEY </p>
What's this even for? Is it a punishment?
<p class = "character"> TROY </p>
Is this your way of telling us Formula One is finally a class at Greendale?
<p class = "character"> THE DEAN  </p>
No.
<p class = "character">  TROY </p>
Damn...
<p class = "character"> ABED </p>
Want to turn the study room into a racetrack later?
<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
Get out of my brain
<div class = "action">Troy and Abed do their signature handshake.</div>
<p class = "character"> THE DEAN </p>
Okay, there are serious students that study right outside this room who have made serious complaints about certain study groups using this space for yelling matches and cat fights.
<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
My apartment was being fumigated, my cats had nowhere else to go!
<p class = "character"> THE DEAN  </p>
This 'traffic light' is a noise detector. When it's green you can GO ahead and talk. When it's red you need to STOP immediately. Yellow... well you get the point.
<p class = "character"> ANNIE  </p>
(whispering) And what are the repercussions of it turning red?
<p class = "character"> JEFF  </p>
The alarm can blare all it wants, they can't prevent us from using a private study room we've rightfully signed out of a public facility. The Dean's bluffing.
<p class = "character"> BRITTA  </p>
Aha! Reverse psychology!
<div class = "action">Annie shakes her head at Britta.</div>
<p class = "character"> BRITTA </p>
Okay... normal forwards psychology then.
<p class = "character"> PIERCE  </p>
I find this outrageous. If those noise crusaders have such a problem with us why is this the first time we've heard of it?
<p class = "character"> THE DEAN </p>
It's not! Do you guys listen to anything I say!?
<div class = "action">The Dean raises his voice and causes the traffic light to turn red again. As the alarm blares, the Dean gets flustered and leaves the room from embarrassment.</div>
<p class = "character"> TROY  </p>
(whispering) He really isn't good at this whole discipline thing.
<p class = "character"> PIERCE </p>
Why are you still whispering?
<p class = "character"> TROY </p>
(whispering) Because I don't want another penalty on my license, I already have way too many unpaid speeding tickets.
<div class = "action">Opening sequence.</div>
